Men, women, boys and girls who are absentee parents. Governments who are only pro life in terms of conception but forget and forsake babies when they are born. Healthcare, pre k, safety. Justice, housing, jobs for parents, clean water and environment are left behind. Being pro life should be from the womb to the tomb. "

No one knows the circumstances of what the woman is going through. She could have been raped, the child could have defects, she could be too young to have a child. Yes, there is adoption for a mother to give her healthy baby up, but it's a mother's choice. Not every mother is thinking straight when she becomes pregnant. I would hope that every pregnant mom would have someone to talk to first before making that decision, but ultimately it is her body. My daughter got pregnant at 16 and she couldn't afford to keep her baby, so she allowed us to adopt her child. We are very fortunate to have been able to do this, but not everyone can. We also told our daughter we would do this only once. We adopted her at the age of 5 when we were in our 40's. When we adopted our granddaughter, we were in our late 50's. She is 8 years old, and we are 63 and 67. Our daughter since then has had 2 abortions, we just couldn't possibly raise 2 other children. The courts told her the same thing; we couldn't adopt anymore children. I wish she would use birth control, but she won't. "
